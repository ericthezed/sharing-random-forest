Predicting Facebook Sharing

A Random Forest model was used to train and test several factors to determine the best predictors of whether or not a user would share an article on Facebook. Such factors included # of previous sessions, average # of pageviews per previous session, # of pageviews in current session, previous share count, previous pageview count, article shareability, article pageviews, whether or not the user had previously subscribed, and time since the userâ€™s first visit.

It was found the the best predictors of sharing were number of shares in previous sessions, total number of previous sessions, article shareability, whether the user was on a mobile device, and time (in days) since the user's first visit. The model yielded a misclassification rate of 36.8%, which means sharing was correctly predicted 63.2% of the time.
